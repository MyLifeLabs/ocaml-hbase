Hbase bindings for OCaml

Depends on thrift (git://git.apache.org/thrift.git) compiler and library. Tested with revision 9623fc5476b8c7225b7d9f543d631e5240891f99.

'make generate' will download version 0.90.3 of Hbase and generate the ocaml bindings from the thrift specification.
'make' will build the bindings.
'make install' will install the bindings with ocamlfind.
